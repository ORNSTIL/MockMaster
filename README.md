## Project Description
Our project is essentially about creating a simpler, more interactive way for fantasy football enthusiasts to do mock drafts. Users will be able to sign up, join mock drafts, and pick players to build their teams. Everything is designed to be user-friendly, so even if you're new to fantasy football, you can jump right in and start drafting. We're putting a lot of thought into how we organize this data to make the drafting process smooth and enjoyable. For example, we're planning systems that automatically update draft orders and player rosters as the draft progresses. Our aim is to create a mock draft platform that feels intuitive and responds instantly to every choice, making every user feel like they're right in the middle of the action.
